# Gray-Scott simulator
Reaction Diffusion simulation of Gray-Scott model.
Gray-Scott equations are partial differential equations that model the time evolution of three reacting and diffusing chemical species. 
Their ability to generate beautiful patterns that resemble naturally observed patterns makes them interesting.
